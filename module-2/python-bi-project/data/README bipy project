## 1. Write down the "big questions" to be asnwered with this project
    
    1. What is the "Top 10" of the best paid jobs for a Data Analyst?✔ (Bio-Tech, Real Estate)
    2. What is the industry sector that that has the better rankings for DA work?✔ (IT)
    3. Are there any jobs with a remote option? ✔ (yes)
    4. What is the proportion of entry level vs senior level jobs? ✔ (6.4%)
    5. If both #4 and #3 return positive results: Is there any job that is junior and remote? ✔ (yes)
    
    5. Avoid this:

## 2. Selecting a dataset
    
    The file used in this project was created by picklesueat[1] and is available to download at kaggle[2].
    As per the abstract reads:
            "Looking for a job as Data Analyst? Maybe this dataset can help you."


        
## 3. Getting the data in the same dataframe
    
    First things first: download data. ✔
    
    step 2. load data to the main.ipynb file. ✔    
    ##learnt something! -> there is a pathlib module[3]
    ##learnt something! -> sometimes the csv's won't cooperate as expected and data wrangling becomes a bit troublesome.
    ##learnt something! -> a very easy way of cleaning dataframe columns is with RegEx
    ##learnt something! -> another way of cleaning is to split into using lists using regex, 
                    modify by ".insert" and ".pop", and get the obtained panda.Series to a dataframe.
    ##learnt something! -> split on first ocurrence of pattern [4]
    ##learnt something! -> when reading a csv, separators can be Regex
    ##Struggle -> some ideas are more complicated or trickier to implement than others.
                    Changing from plan A to plan B:
                        plan A) datasets of Mexican exports 1998-2018.
                        plan B) Data Analyst Jobs dataset.
                 
    step 3. clean data, set appropiate dtypes. ✔
    ##learnt something! -> If a number can't be converted to integer or returns an OverFloeError,
                            it's worth trying to convert it to float
    ##learnt something! -> It's good practice to specify data type as string for columns with letters.
    
    step 4. different visualizations have to be used in order to get the more out of the available data. ✔
    ##learnt something! -> multi graph
