Final project for the Ironhack Data analytics class of August-October 2020

Project: Real-time image recognition
Specifics: Plate number recogition and classification of Letters [A-Z] and numbers [0-9]

Input: any photo of a car where the palte is visible
Output: list of the components associated with their individual images, i.e.:
	  "N"	  "U"	  "C"	  "6"	  "1"	  "0"	  "9"	<--- List of np.alpha characters

	img_1	img_2	img_3	img_4	img_5	img_6	img_7	<--- Each character of the plate
